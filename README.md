# KTV Anywhere

#### A karaoke song system for everyone

[![Electron](https://github.com/weiquany/KTVAnywhere/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weiquany/KTVAnywhere/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Available for Windows OS

## Aim

While karaoke has been around for many years, casual singers usually go to karaoke joints instead of having a home karaoke system due to the high set-up cost and subscription service. Therefore, we hope to make a self-hosted karaoke song system that is easy to deploy for personal use. It would only require a working computer and songs the users already have. We hope to make it seamless and provide a fun and interactive karaoke experience for all ages.

### Implemented Features

- A queue system to manage songs
- Vocal separation from user-provided tracks
- Lyrics retrieval from NetEase Cloud Music
- Audio player with key shifting and tempo adjustment functionality
- Lyrics player with basic adjustments with offset
- Automatic pitch graph generation and display
- Up to 2 microphones supported with reverb and noise suppression

### Proposed features

- Pitch graph and scoring

## Technologies

KTV Anywhere uses the following technlogies:

- [Electron] - Cross-platform desktop deployment
- [ReactJS] - For the application's frontend
- [spleeter] - For the vocal separation feature
- [SoundTouchJS] - For the pitch shifting functionality
- [Basic Pitch] - For audio to pitch conversion
- [RNNoise] - For microphone noise suppression
